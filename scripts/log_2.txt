Here are the events and conversations that have occurred so far: (no other events or conversations have occurred yet)
- Naomi said: Hello everyone, on this first day of the game, I want to share my suspicion about Xavier. There's something about his demeanor that makes me believe he could be a member of the Mafia. This is just my gut feeling and could be completely wrong, but I think it's worth considering. Let's keep an eye on Xavier's actions and see if there are any more signs.
- Naomi accused Xavier of being a Mafia.
- Xavier said: Hey everyone, it's interesting that Naomi is so quick to suspect me without any evidence. I think her accusations are baseless and she might be trying to divert attention from herself. Let's not forget that accusations can go both ways. I suspect Naomi might be a Mafia member and is trying to frame me. We should keep an eye on her as well.
- Xavier accused Naomi of being a Mafia.
- Abigail said: Everyone, it's interesting to see Xavier and Naomi accusing each other. While Naomi's suspicion of Xavier could be valid, I believe we should focus on her for now. Xavier has pointed out that Naomi might be trying to frame him and I think there could be some truth to that. Let's keep a close eye on Naomi's actions and see if there are any more signs of her involvement with the Mafia.
- Abigail accused Naomi of being a Mafia.
- Vis said: My fellow players, after carefully considering the accusations and counter-accusations, I have a suspicion that Xavier may be a member of the Mafia. I believe we should keep a close eye on his actions and gather more evidence to either confirm or refute this suspicion.
- Vis accused Xavier of being a Mafia.
- Sophia said: Dear fellow players, upon considering the arguments presented, I find Xavier's defense more convincing than Naomi's accusation. Naomi's suspicion appears to be solely based on intuition without concrete evidence. Therefore, I accuse Naomi of being a member of the Mafia. Let's keep a close eye on her actions and gather more evidence to support or disprove this suspicion.
