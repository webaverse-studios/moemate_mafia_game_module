Fix https://github.com/webaverse-studios/moemate/issues/1416

Need work with https://github.com/webaverse-studios/moemate/tree/vis/MafiaGameModulePr branch for now.

### Example game log:
Here are the events and conversations that have occurred so far:
- Naomi said: Greetings, fellow players. As the game begins, I have been closely observing everyone's actions and words. Based on the information available right now, I suspect Abigail might be a member of the Mafia. The way she reacted during our initial discussions seemed rather suspicious to me. However, I'm open to hearing others' thoughts and opinions on this matter.
- Naomi accused Abigail of being a Mafia.
- Vis said: Greetings everyone. As we begin the game, I believe it's crucial for us to keep an open mind and not jump to conclusions too quickly. While Naomi has expressed her suspicion towards Abigail, I would urge everyone to consider all perspectives and gather more evidence before making any definitive accusations. Let's engage in constructive discussions and share our thoughts and suspicions to collectively make informed decisions. It's still early, and we need to remain cautious and objective in our approach.
- Vis accused  of being a Mafia.
- Sebastian said: Greetings everyone. As we begin this game, it is essential for us to consider multiple perspectives and not fixate on individual suspicions. While Abigail has been accused by Naomi, I find it intriguing that Naomi is so quick to point fingers without substantial evidence. It seems like a classic misdirection tactic that the Mafia would employ. Therefore, I suspect Naomi is a member of the Mafia.
- Sebastian accused Naomi of being a Mafia.
- Abigail said: Greetings, everyone. As we engage in this game, it's crucial for us to carefully consider the evidence and not rush to conclusions. I've noticed that Naomi was quick to accuse me without substantial evidence. This behavior could be a tactic employed by the Mafia to deflect suspicions. Therefore, I suspect Naomi to be a member of the Mafia.
- Abigail accused Naomi of being a Mafia.
- Sophia said: Greetings everyone. As we engage in this game, it is important for us to consider all possibilities. I have observed Vis closely, and their attempts at appearing objective and reasonable could be a tactic employed by the Mafia. Therefore, I suspect Vis to be a member of the Mafia.
- Sophia accused Vis of being a Mafia.
- Xavier said: Greetings everyone. As we begin this game, I have been carefully listening to the discussions, and based on the information presented, I find Sebastian's accusation against Naomi to be suspicious. His claim that Naomi's quick accusation is a misdirection tactic seems like an attempt to deflect suspicion away from himself. Therefore, I suspect Sebastian to be a member of the Mafia. However, I encourage everyone to keep an open mind and continue gathering information before making any definitive decisions.
- Xavier accused Sebastian of being a Mafia.
- Naomi voted Sebastian of being a Mafia.
- Vis voted Sophia of being a Mafia.
- Sebastian voted Xavier of being a Mafia.
- Abigail voted No Vote of being a Mafia.
- Sophia voted Naomi of being a Mafia.
- Xavier voted Sebastian of being a Mafia.
- Sebastian was voted out, and Sebastian was a Mafia.
- Xavier was killed by Mafia, and Xavier was a Civilian.

Thinkings:
- Naomi as Civilian: I have been observing the interactions and behaviors of all the players so far. Based on what I've noticed, I believe Abigail might be a member of the Mafia.
- Vis as Civilian: Based on the available information, I think it's too early to make any definitive accusations. It's important to keep an open mind and gather more evidence before pointing fingers at anyone.
- Sebastian as Mafia: I need to create confusion and shift suspicion away from me and Sophia, while also identifying a potential target as a diversion.
- Abigail as Civilian: After considering the accusations made so far, I believe Sebastian's reasoning for suspecting Naomi is more substantial. Sebastian's point about Naomi quickly accusing me without evidence does raise some doubts about her intentions. Therefore, my accusation is towards Naomi.
- Sophia as Mafia: Based on the conversations so far, it seems that suspicion has been cast on both Naomi and Abigail. To divert attention away from myself and Sebastian, I will accuse Vis of being a member of the Mafia.
- Xavier as Civilian: Based on the discussions so far, I believe it's important to carefully analyze each accusation and gather more information. While everyone has made compelling arguments, I find Sebastian's accusation against Naomi to be particularly suspicious. Sebastian's claim that Naomi's quick accusation is a misdirection tactic seems like an attempt to deflect attention away from himself. Therefore, I suspect Sebastian to be a member of the Mafia.
- Naomi as Civilian: Based on the conversations so far, I have considered everyone's perspectives and accusations. While I initially suspected Abigail, Sebastian's accusation against me seems like an attempt to deflect suspicion. Therefore, I believe Sebastian is a member of the Mafia.
- Vis as Civilian: Based on the conversations and accusations so far, I find Sophia's accusation against me to be suspicious. It seems like an attempt to divert attention away from herself. However, I will keep an open mind and continue gathering information before making my final decision.
- Sebastian as Mafia: Based on the discussions so far, it seems like suspicions have been cast on multiple players. However, I need to ensure that Sophia, the other Mafia member, is not voted out. Therefore, my best strategy would be to cast my vote for Xavier, as he has accused me of being a Mafia and his reasoning seems sound.
- Abigail as Civilian: Based on the conversations so far, I am suspicious of Naomi's quick accusation and Sebastian's attempt to deflect suspicion. However, I don't have enough evidence to make a definitive decision. I should consider all perspectives before voting.
- Sophia as Mafia: Based on the conversations so far, it seems like Naomi and Sebastian are both looking suspicious. Their attempts to divert attention and accuse others without substantial evidence could be tactics employed by the Mafia. However, I need to consider the voting patterns as well.
- Xavier as Civilian: Based on the conversations and accusations so far, I believe that Sebastian's accusation against Naomi seems suspicious and could be an attempt to deflect suspicion away from himself. Therefore, I suspect Sebastian to be a member of the Mafia.
- Sophia as Mafia: Based on the events and conversations so far, it seems that the suspicions have been divided between Naomi, Vis, Abigail, and Xavier. However, since I know that Sebastian is also a Mafia, I want to create more chaos and divert suspicion away from myself and Sebastian by targeting Xavier for the kill.
